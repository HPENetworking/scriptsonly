    "# Intro to working with FlexFabric Netconf API\n",
    "\n",
    "In this article, we'll look at using the pyhpecw7 library to connect via Netconf to a HPE FlexFabric 5900 switch.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although the HPE FlexFabric Data Center switching portfolio supports multiple ways to interact with it, including CLI, SNMP, TCL & Python shells, as well as a REST API, the Netconf API does give us certain advantages including the ability to stage a configuration before we commit it to the running state of the device. \n",
    "\n",
    "Although we could look at using the python [**NCCLIENT**](http://ncclient.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) library and interact with the library using the XSD definitions included when you download the software for the device, HPE has also kindly provided a pythonic wrapper specific to the FlexFabric Netconf interface which you can install directly using the standard python PIP process. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "First we'll need to make sure we import the library, if you don't have that yet, remember it's just *pip install pyhpecw7*\n",
    "\n",
    "*Note: As opposed to what it looks like on the Github repo. I did not write this library. It was commisioned to be written by a 3rd party consultant who did a great job and who now bears no responsibility for the library anymore. You know who you are.*"
