    "## The good part\n",
    "\n",
    "For those who have done some scripting to device before, you'll have noticed that using an API provided by an NMS such as [HPEIMC](http://www.hpe.com/networking/imc) makes life much easier. We didn't have to worry about username and passwords for the individual devces, nor having to worry about deciding what protocol we need to use to connect to the device. The great part about using the NMS as a proxy is that all the credential and protocl negotiations are all handled by the NMS itself, allowing us to get on to the trouble of worrying about what we want to send to our devices and not concerning with how they actually get there. \n",

    "\n",
    "## Configuration Drift\n",
    "\n",
    "If you look closely, we've actually got an extra VLAN in there. **VLAN 5** has been configured on the device, but it's not in our list of desired_vlans where we have declared exactly which VLANs should be on the target device. This is what is sometimes known as configuration drift. Some people may say \n",

    "> Hey, It's just an extra VLAN right? That won't hurt us!\n",
    "\n",
    "Sorry to respectfully disagree, but this attitude is exactly what causes us issues. This is the death of a thousand cuts. It's **JUST** one VLAN, **JUST** one switch running a differnet version of code, **JUST** one router that has some unused sub-interfaces on it.\n",
    "\n",
    "**IT'S JUST ONE MORE THING THAT WILL BITE YOU WHEN YOU'RE TROUBLESHOOTING AN ISSUE.**\n",
    "\n",
    "These **JUST** things are what we sometimes call technical debt. If you can figure out out. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Vendor Syntax\n",
    "\n",
    "The other problem with this example is that we are bound to a specific vendor's syntax. If you attmept to run the **system-view** command on a Juniper/Cisco/Brocade/Extreme/ARISTA device, it's going to error out. Right?  This coule easily be addressed by some conditional logic which figures out which kind of a box it is first and then leverages a specific Jinja template for that vendor, but you can see how this becomes a slippery slope rather quickly. \n",
