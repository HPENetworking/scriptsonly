    "\n",
    "It was originally developed to help automatically generate HTML dynamically as part of the flask framework, more on that in another post, but it can also easily be used to help us generate our configuration files for our infrastructure devices. \n",

    "This is going to be a very simple introduction to a few of the basic concepts of that jinja uses which, hopefully, will help to understand how Jinja can be used as a first step down the road of gaining automation skills. \n",
    "\n",
    "We'll take a look at a developing some intuition on how Jinja2 can be used to create basic network infrastructure device configurations. This is definitly not the modern method of interfacing directly into the control/data/management plane of devices using APIs, but it's definitely a step in the right direction on understanding how a bit of code can help make your life better. \n",

    "## Prereqs\n",

    "I'm assuming you've already got [python](http://www.python.org) installed on your system. You're also going to need to run the ** *pip install jinja2* ** command from a terminal window to get the latest version of jinja2 which should work just fine here. "
