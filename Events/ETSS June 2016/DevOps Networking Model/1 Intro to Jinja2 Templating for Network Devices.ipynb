    "We'll take a look at a developing some intuition on how Jinja2 can be used to create basic network infrastructure device configurations. This is definitly not the modern method of interfacing directly into the control/data/management plane of devices using APIs, but it's definitely a step in the right direction on understanding how a bit of code can help make your life better. \n",
